<div class="container">


<p>I have worked on alot of project, I wanted to provide an overview for my Capstone, I have also included a list of past projects and suggested ideas for future projects. </p>


<h1 class="font-weight-bold">Winter Break Project.</h1>

<p> * I have been focused on Kaggle Data Compentitions, which are extremly hard. I am currently in the top 1/3 of this https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-breast-cancer-detection competition.</p>

<p> * For my Winter Break I am working on using extisting AI / API. I developeded some q & a prompt python scrips using OpenAI and compared that to the ChatAI to see the function difference between single imput promprt and Chats </p>

<p> * addationally  I have been looking at non-neuronetwork method of stock market pattern - have python look at charts and find patterns vs feeding the open / close to a NN</p>
