    Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse set of projects. I aim to provide a comprehensive overview of my past work and offer suggestions for potential future endeavors. In addition, I have included a list of my previous projects for reference. I am continually seeking new opportunities to challenge myself and improve my abilities in data science and machine learning. I am open to new ideas and suggestions for future projects. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments. Thank you for your time and consideration.


<h1 class="font-weight-bold">Winter Break Project.</h1>

<p> <large> (1)</large> I have been dedicating my efforts towards participating in data competitions on Kaggle, which are known to be highly challenging. Through my participation, I have been able to consistently perform in the top tier of competitors, placing in the top 1/3 of participants. The rigor and difficulty of Kaggle competitions have provided me with valuable experience in tackling complex data problems, and has helped me to develop my analytical and technical skills. I am continually seeking new opportunities to challenge myself and improve my abilities in data science and machine learning.<br><br>
    Current Focus ->  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-breast-cancer-detection .</p>

<p> <large>2</large> During my winter break, I have been engaged in a research project focused on utilizing existing artificial intelligence (AI) and application programming interfaces (APIs). I have developed a set of Python scripts utilizing OpenAI's API for question and answer prompts, and have been comparing their performance to that of a chat-based AI system. Through this comparison, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the functional differences between single-input prompts and chat-based interfaces, and to explore the potential for these technologies in various applications. This project represents a valuable opportunity for me to apply my skills in AI and programming, and to expand my knowledge of this rapidly evolving field. </p>

<p><large>3</large> Finally -  I have been engaged in a research project that explores the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for analyzing stock market patterns. Specifically, I have been examining the potential of using RNNs to analyze stock charts and identify patterns that can be used to predict future market trends. Additionally, I have been investigating non-neural network methods for stock market pattern recognition, such as using Python to analyze charts and identify patterns directly, as opposed to feeding open and close data into a neural network. This project represents a valuable opportunity for me to apply my skills in machine learning and data analysis, and to gain a deeper understanding of the potential of these technologies for stock market prediction.</p>

    <p>Description: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning models that consist of two sub-models: a generator and a discriminator. The generator produces synthetic data that is intended to resemble real-world data, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between the synthetic data and real-world data. The two sub-models are trained in an adversarial manner, with the generator trying to produce synthetic data that can fool the discriminator, and the discriminator trying to accurately distinguish between synthetic and real data.<br>GANs have been used to generate a wide range of data, including images, text, and audio. They have been used in applications such as image synthesis, super-resolution, style transfer, and text-to-speech. GANs have also been used to improve the performance of other machine learning models, such as in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing.<br><br>

        It is important to conduct a comprehensive literature review on GANs for several reasons:<br>

        GANs are a relatively new and rapidly evolving field, with new developments and improvements being made on a regular basis. A literature review can provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in GANs and help identify potential areas for future research.<br><br>

        GANs have been applied to a wide range of fields and applications. A literature review can help identify the most promising and impactful applications of GANs and the specific challenges that need to be addressed.<br><br>

        GANs have many hyperparameters that can be adjusted, and it is important to understand the impact of these parameters on the performance of GANs. A literature review can provide insights into the best practices for training GANs and the trade-offs between different hyperparameter settings.<br><br>

        GANs are a challenging model to train, and there are many challenges that need to be addressed such as mode collapse and stability of the training process. A literature review can help identify the best practices for addressing these challenges and the latest research on these challenges.<br>

        Overall, GANs have shown to be a powerful tool for various systems and applications, and a comprehensive literature review will help to understand the impact of GANs in various systems and applications as well as the challenges that need to be addressed. <br></p>

        <h3 class="text-lg" >3.) Hotel Booking</h3>
        < <span class="label label-primary">Related Class: MIS 761 Business Analytics Methods</span>
    <p>Description: The identification of cancellation trends and understanding their impact on revenue is a critical task in hotel management. The problem of cancellations and overbooking is a significant challenge that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. These issues can result in lost revenue, wasted resources, and poor customer satisfaction. Machine learning is a powerful tool that can help predict and mitigate these issues by providing insights and predictions based on historical data. For example, a machine learning model could be trained on data such as past cancellation patterns, booking dates, and customer demographics to identify patterns and trends in cancellations. By analyzing this data, the model could then make predictions about future cancellations and help hotel managers take proactive measures to reduce the impact of cancellations on revenue. Moreover, machine learning models can also be used for identifying the reasons for cancellations and providing insights to hotel managers to take specific actions to reduce cancellations in those areas. Overall, machine learning can play an important role in addressing the challenges of cancellations and overbooking in hotel management. By providing insights and predictions based on historical data, machine learning can help hotel managers make more informed decisions and take proactive measures to reduce the impact of cancellations on revenue.</p>

        <h3 class="text-lg" >4.) Dual Attention RNN </h3>
        <span class="label label-primary">Related Class: BIOL 616 Bioinformatics</span>
    <p>Description: The spread of COVID-19 has led to increased focus on the potential use of waste water surveillance as a means of early detection and tracking of the virus. However, traditional models that rely on linear regression (LR) for predicting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the general population have several shortcomings. In order to address these limitations, this study proposes an improved modeling approach that utilizes dual attention and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).<br><br>

        This approach accounts for seasonal variations and viral mutations, which are important factors that can affect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in waste water. The proposed model is based on an existing model and has been retooled to incorporate dual attention and RNNs, which are known to improve the performance of machine learning models in time-series data.<br><br>

        The proposed model was evaluated using a dataset of waste water samples collected from a specific location, and the results were compared to those obtained using traditional LR models. The results showed that the proposed model outperforms traditional LR models in terms of prediction accuracy, which indicates the potential of this approach for improving waste water surveillance for COVID-19.<br><br>

        In summary, this study presents an improved modeling approach for waste water surveillance of COVID-19 that utilizes dual attention and RNNs. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional LR models by accounting for seasonal variations and viral mutations, which are important factors that can affect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in waste water. The results of this study suggest that this approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of COVID-19 waste water surveillance.</p>
