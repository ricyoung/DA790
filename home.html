    Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse set of projects. I aim to provide a comprehensive overview of my past work and offer suggestions for potential future endeavors. In addition, I have included a list of my previous projects for reference


<h1 class="font-weight-bold">Winter Break Project.</h1>

<p> * I have been focused on Kaggle Data Compentitions, which are extremly hard. I am currently in the top 1/3 of this https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-breast-cancer-detection competition.</p>

<p> * For my Winter Break I am working on using extisting AI / API. I developeded some q & a prompt python scrips using OpenAI and compared that to the ChatAI to see the function difference between single imput promprt and Chats </p>

<p> * addationally  I have been looking at non-neuronetwork method of stock market pattern - have python look at charts and find patterns vs feeding the open / close to a NN</p>

        <strong>2a.) DARNN on Stock Markets</strong>
        <strong>2b.) Charts on Stock Markets</strong>
        <p>Description: Predicting the stock market is a challenging task that has traditionally relied on analyzing numerical data such as stock prices. However, recent advancements in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown promise in utilizing graphical data, such as PNGs and graphs, as a novel approach to understanding and predicting stock market trends. This research aims to investigate the effectiveness of RNNs in utilizing graphical data to predict stock market movements. The goal of this study is to develop a model that can effectively analyze and interpret graphical data, and use this information to make accurate predictions about the stock market. The ultimate aim is to provide a new and innovative approach to stock market prediction that can improve upon traditional methods.</p>

        <strong>3.) Improved Methods to track CHF</strong>
    <p>Description: Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) is a prevalent and costly medical condition that is becoming increasingly common as the population ages. To improve treatment for CHF patients, it is essential to develop a methodology for tracking readmission rates in a timely and efficient manner. Current methods for tracking CHF readmission rates often require a significant amount of time before results are available, causing delays in implementing necessary changes to treatment protocols. This study aims to explore alternative methodologies that can provide real-time insights on CHF readmission rates, with the ultimate goal of improving treatment outcomes and reducing healthcare costs associated with CHF. </p>

        <strong> 1.) Using Public Data to look for CTE  </strong>
        <p class="text-sm-left" >Description: Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a debilitating condition thought to be caused by repeated head injuries. The ability to detect and diagnose CTE early on is crucial for preventing further harm and providing appropriate treatment. Utilizing publicly available data from YouTube videos, this research aims to investigate the potential of using machine learning techniques to detect CTE in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighters. However, the proposed methodology can also be applied to other contact sports such as football players. Las Vegas, being a hub for both MMA fighters and the Combat Sports industry, is uniquely positioned to conduct this research and make significant contributions to the understanding and detection of CTE. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a reliable and non-invasive method for detecting CTE in contact sports athletes.</p>

        <strong>2.) Information On GANs</strong>
    <p>Description: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning models that consist of two sub-models: a generator and a discriminator. The generator produces synthetic data that is intended to resemble real-world data, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between the synthetic data and real-world data. The two sub-models are trained in an adversarial manner, with the generator trying to produce synthetic data that can fool the discriminator, and the discriminator trying to accurately distinguish between synthetic and real data.<br>GANs have been used to generate a wide range of data, including images, text, and audio. They have been used in applications such as image synthesis, super-resolution, style transfer, and text-to-speech. GANs have also been used to improve the performance of other machine learning models, such as in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing.<br>

        It is important to conduct a comprehensive literature review on GANs for several reasons:

        GANs are a relatively new and rapidly evolving field, with new developments and improvements being made on a regular basis. A literature review can provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in GANs and help identify potential areas for future research.

        GANs have been applied to a wide range of fields and applications. A literature review can help identify the most promising and impactful applications of GANs and the specific challenges that need to be addressed.

        GANs have many hyperparameters that can be adjusted, and it is important to understand the impact of these parameters on the performance of GANs. A literature review can provide insights into the best practices for training GANs and the trade-offs between different hyperparameter settings.

        GANs are a challenging model to train, and there are many challenges that need to be addressed such as mode collapse and stability of the training process. A literature review can help identify the best practices for addressing these challenges and the latest research on these challenges.

        Overall, GANs have shown to be a powerful tool for various systems and applications, and a comprehensive literature review will help to understand the impact of GANs in various systems and applications as well as the challenges that need to be addressed.. </p>
